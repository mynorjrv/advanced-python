# Best practices and Standardization

## PEPs

Stands for **Python Enhancement Proposals**, they are a collection of online documents that outlines the language standards and provides information about many changes and processes related to Python.

There are a lot of PEPs, the index can be found in the [https://peps.python.org/](PEP 0). For now we are focusing on four:

- PEP 1 - PEP Purpose and Guidelines, which provides information about the purpose of PEPs, their types, and introduces general guidelines;
- PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code, which gives conventions and presents best practices for Python coding;
- PEP 20 – The Zen of Python, which presents a list of principles for Python’s design;
- PEP 257 – Docstring Conventions, which provides guidelines for conventions and semantics associated with Python docstrings.

## PEP 1

From the PEP itself: 

> PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. A PEP is a design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment. The PEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

According to Edube, a PEP is a collection of guidelines, best practices, descriptions of (new) features and implementations, as well as processes, mechanisms and important information surrounding Python.

### Types of PEPs

There are three kinds of PEPs:


- **Standards Track** PEPs, which describe new language features and implementations;
- **Informational** PEPs, which describe Python design issues, as well as provide guidelines and information to the Python community;
- **Process** PEPs, which describe various processes that revolve around Python (e.g., propose changes, provide recommendations, specify certain procedures). Process PEPs are like Standards Track PEPs but apply to areas other than the Python language itself.

### PEP Audience

Literally from the PEP itself:

> The typical primary audience for PEPs are the core developers of the CPython reference interpreter and their elected Steering Council, as well as developers of other implementations of the Python language specification.

> However, other parts of the Python community may also choose to use the process (particularly for Informational PEPs) to document expected API conventions and to manage complex design coordination problems that require collaboration across multiple projects.

### PEP workflow

Again... All taken from the PEP itsel:

The PEP process begins with a new idea for Python. It is highly recommended that a single PEP contain a single key proposal or new idea; the more focused the PEP, the more successful it tends to be.

Each PEP must have a champion (a.k.a. Author) – someone who writes the PEP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea.

Formats, templates and the submission process as well as subsequent stages are all described in PEP 1.

Also, the PEP defines:


- Python’s Steering Council, i.e., a five-person committee and the final authorities who accept or reject PEPs;
- Python’s Core Developers, i.e., the group of volunteers who manage Python, and;
- Python’s BDFL, i.e., Guido van Rossum, the original creator of Python, who served as the project’s Benevolent Dictator For Life until 2018, when he resigned from the decision-making process. This title changed, and PEP-Delegate is used instead of BDFL-Delegate.
