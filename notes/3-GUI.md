# GUI Programming using tkinter

A **Graphical User Interface** is a visible tool used to command or receive responses from a device. Now days, a great number of electronic devices are equipped with screens, most of them colored and they display a GUI.

## A brief history: terminals

For a time, displays were not treated as a part of computers. Computers were big boxes with lights and switches. To control those computers, a specialized separate device called a **terminal** was used. The terminal was wired to the computer and could be placed in a different place.

Terminals were monochrome and displayed only letters, digits and a few other characters. This fact dictated the way software was built for a log time.

Terminals were just equipped with keyboards. No mice, no touch screens, no trackballs. Some of them could be equipped with a light pen, which was used to point screen areas and acted in a similar way to a mouse, but they were very inconvenient.

In this scenario, how was computer-user interaction organized? The answer is in a strictly textual way. A main screen was just text, they were typically of 80 columns and 25 lines. The user's answers were given by pressing a set of allowed keys. 

From a developer's perspective, this way of interacting is simple. From a user's point of view, this is difficult and inconvenient. This is why GUIs were developed, they are more flexible, intuitive and in general nicer.
